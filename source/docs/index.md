### Supported Browsers

We designed the NexT theme to support a wide range of mainstream browsers, include the current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. Many CSS3 and ES6 features and new Web APIs have been utilized, including CSS Variables, [IntersectionObserver](https://caniuse.com/intersectionobserver) and [Fetch API](https://caniuse.com/fetch), to make the NexT theme's code more concise, reliable, and secure. Statistics show that NexT is compatible with more than 96% of browsers.

| Browser | Supported versions | Release date |
| - | - | - |
<i class="fab fa-internet-explorer fa-2x"></i> IE | N/A | Oct 17, 2013 |
<i class="fab fa-chrome fa-2x"></i> Chrome | 69+ | Sep 4, 2018 |
<i class="fab fa-firefox-browser fa-2x"></i> Firefox | 62+ | Sep 5, 2018 |
<i class="fab fa-opera fa-2x"></i> Opera | 56+ | Sep 25, 2018 |
<i class="fab fa-safari fa-2x"></i> Safari | 12.1+ | Mar 25, 2019 |
<i class="fab fa-edge fa-2x"></i> Edge | 80+ | Feb 7, 2020 |

*The criterion being that on these browsers, the core functionalities and styles of the NexT theme work normally, excluding third-party plugins.*

Many modern browsers, such as Chrome and Edge, support automatic updates, and we recommend users keep their browsers up to date. However, the versions of some browsers are tied to the operating system, such as Safari and IE, and NexT cannot guarantee compatibility with their older versions.
